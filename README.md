</br><b>Eye Tracking Analysis and Visualization</b>
</br>This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing eye tracking data collected under different experimental conditions. The analysis focuses on comparing eye movement metrics between participants who were "Not Tasked" and those who were "Tasked" during the experiment.

</br><b>Overview</b>
</br>The analysis includes:
</br>Data Preparation: Cleaning and organizing eye tracking data for statistical analysis.
</br>Statistical Analysis: Utilizing Python libraries such as numpy, scipy, and pandas to perform statistical tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to compare eye movement metrics.
</br>Visualization: Visualizing the data distribution using histograms, box plots, and violin plots to understand differences in eye movement metrics between groups.
</br>Insights: Deriving insights from the analysis to understand the impact of tasking on eye movements.
